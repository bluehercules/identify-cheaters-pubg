    "    3. date when the player's account was banned due to cheating\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `kills.txt` – contains the killings done in 6,000 randomly selected matches played between March 1 and March 10, 2019\n",
    "    1. match id \n",
    "    2. account id of the killer\n",
    "    3. account id of the player who got killed\n",
    "    4. time when the kill happened\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* `team_ids.txt` – contains the team ids for players in 5,419 team-play matches in the same period. If a match from the kills.txt file does not appear in these data, we will assume that it was in single-player mode.  \n",

    "The tasks ask you to output actual counts and expecteded counts (mean with 95% confidence interval). To estimate the 95% conifdence intervals, ignore the small sample size and the fact that we are dealing with count data, and simply use the approximation: 95% CI $= \\mu \\pm 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ the standard deviation of the counts in the $n=20$ randomizations. You are free to use `statsmodels` or `numpy` to calculate these values.\n",
